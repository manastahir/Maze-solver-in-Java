# Maze-solver-in-Java
Solve large Maze problems, using graphs
<hr/>

<p>
Did this project in my free time after getting inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/mikepound"> Professor Michael Pound's<a> video on 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI">Computerphile<a>. This is my implemetation of the same project in JAVA.
</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>
Implemeted graph search algorithms for finding the path through large mazes. Given the path to the input maze the program give the time to solve the maze and output solved maze.<br/>
<b>Implemented algorithms</b>
<ul>
<li>Depth First Search</li>
<li>Breadth First Search</li>
<li>A* Search</li>
</ul>
Note: The code assumes that white pixel is the path, black is the wall, entry is on the top wall and exit is on the bottom wall. These limitations could have been solved
